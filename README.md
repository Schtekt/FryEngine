# FryEngine - An aspiring game engine

## About
FryEngine is a hobby project currently in initial stages of development. It aspires to become a game engine supporting 3D graphics through software rendering for Windows.

This project is used to explore different techniques and is in no way meant for commercial use. As this project is developed during my own free time updates may vary greatly! If you in any way decide to use this engine, please have this in mind.

## Setup
### Requirements for setup
* The project is developed to windows and therefore only supports this OS.
* Premake5 needs to be installed and added to environment variables.
* Some version of visual studio is installed

### Setup the workspace
Run the Setup_Workspace.bat script to generate the visual studio solution. A **.sln** file will be generated from this, open it in visual studio.
